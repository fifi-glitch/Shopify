    <h1>About us ,meaning me.</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Shopify! We are dedicated to make copies of your favourite kpop clothing. My mission is to make everyone as fashionable as their favourite biases,cause people need a glow up(meaning you.)</p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>It all started when I wanted a thunderous stage outfit, but I soon figured Amazon doesn't sell that, I'm still in shock. We have grown from coping @https://www.fashionchingu.com/c/kpop-fashion/, and today we are proud to offer clothes that we bargain from there..</p>

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Coolness</li>
        <li>Creativity</li>
        <li>Customer Satisfaction,(i guess)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
    <p>We are passionate about the variety of clothing options, and we strive to deliver the best experience for our users. We  also promise to make blackpink clothes( I really don't like Jennie tho, my favourite is Lisa :P) .</p>
